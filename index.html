        <p>Salesperson/Foreign Exchange Trader</p>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre BusinessðŸ“š</div>  
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is David Slychenyuk. I am currently majoring in Pre-Business as I am still not sure what to choose when it comes to my future. I come from a long line of Slavic people that originated in Europe. I was born in America, but still, speak the languages that have migrated to the United States. My mother is Belarussian and my father is Ukrainian. Although my mother is Belarussian, and my father a Ukrainian, we usually speak Russian in the household. <br><br>

        I have always been interested in the field of Business. When I was a child, money to me was extremely valuable. When my parents would end up giving me a dollar, I used that money to buy some candy, which I would instantly sell to some other children my age to make a profit. As I got older, it was pretty much the same until high school started. I got extremely lazy and stopped selling things to other students. I never got it to an actual business like some of my other friends, I only did it for the fun. I honestly should have taken it a step further to make profits, invest back into the products, and from that point: Rinse and Repeat! <br><br>

        At first, I wanted to go into the medical field, but as time went on, I feel like the business field is more of a strong suit for me. I would say that I am able to work well with others and adapt to situations that are going on. When I talk to others, I am usually laid back and calm, even with complete strangers. Sometimes it might be difficult to adapt to certain types of personalities, as conversing with conservative personalities will not always go smoothly. Currently, I have no idea what I would like to pursue in the Business field of education, but I am sure that will come eventually. I am interested in being a salesperson or be an experienced Foreign Exchange Trader. In the 18 years that I have lived on this earth, I have played my fair share of video games. At that time, a good percentage of that time was spent trading "in-game items" that are worth real money. I start from one item that is worth a couple of cents, then over time, I would barter for items that are valued higher, and eventually reach an item worth 100x more than what I started with. The concept of the market fluctuating and the values going up and down really intrigue me. I have done real Foreign Exchange trading through a "practice" system, but it's created using the real market values. You start with a practice balance of about 3,000 USD, and I managed to work my way up to about 12,000 USD. I feel as though if I end up taking an actual course to study the market trends and be able to calculate the specific instances to deposit or withdraw from the market, I would have a higher chance of being successful in the real scenario that I use my real-life balance to invest.
